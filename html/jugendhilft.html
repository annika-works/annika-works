		    <p class="text">Social work doesn't have to be an adults-only club. On the contrary, there is a lot of youths out there willing to engage themselves for their community and people in need. But how to get money as a teenager? Who to ask? Munich NGO Children e.V. set up a scholarship to support socially engaged children and teens financially as well as in providing networks and knowledge. I was commissioned to develop a visual identity for the overall campaign. Since we're talking to underagers, I decided on a bright colour palette, using fun forms, figures and symbols to both stand out on the wall of a school hallway as well as get the attention of younger children and teenagers alike. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/children.profilseite/" class="info-link">www.facebook.com/children</a></p>
